### 3. Learn the Format

Study the markdown structure to understand:
- Task formatting (`T1.1`, `T2.3`, etc.)
- Status indicators (`TODO`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `DONE`)
- Complexity levels (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`)
- Dependency tracking
- Progress calculations

### 4. Copy and Customize

You can copy these examples and customize them:

```bash
cp examples/example-fullstack-plan.md PROJECT_PLAN.md
# Edit PROJECT_PLAN.md with your project details
